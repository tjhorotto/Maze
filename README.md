Maze
The program has a for loop to read and fill the array, after a do loop runs and scans in the time and readings from the gyro. A functions generates the maze using random seeded by time to ensure the maze is random. A series of IF statements controls where the curser can go on the screen, and a timer was needed to keep track of the time. If the player navigates the ‘A’ to the end of the maze you win the game.
